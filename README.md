# Financial-Marketing-and-Supply-Chain-Analysis-For-AtliQ-Hardware
Problem Statement: AtliQ Hardware, a fast-growing consumer electronics company operating in multiple countries, is struggling with its reliance on Excel for data analysis. Excel's basic features are no longer sufficient to handle the increasing amount of data, complexity, and need for scalability. This has made it difficult for the company to generate key reports, such as gross and net sales for all customers, top-performing markets and products by fiscal year, and accurate sales forecasts for each customer. As a result, AtliQ Hardware is unable to make informed decisions in a competitive global market.
